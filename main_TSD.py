                ### Task:
                1. **Generate a Detailed Expaination**:
                   - Integrate the current file(s) content into the Previous Explaination of the project, capturing all relevant changes, additions, or clarifications in the project structure.
                   - Ensure that the Details includes details about:
                     - The purpose and functionality of the current file(s) and previous details.
                     - Any relationships (e.g., dependencies, connections) between the current file(s) and other parts of the project (previous details).
                     - High-level design aspects such as the architecture, modules, services, and data flow.
                   - Provide an **overarching explanation** of the project's purpose, goals, and major components after processing this file(s) (as you will do this cumulatively across multiple files).

                2. **Update the JSON object**:
                   - Update the JSON object to reflect any new or updated information from the current file(s). It should also preserve previous details.
                   - Ensure that all relationships between backend, frontend, database, and API connections are updated.
                   - Maintain consistency in formatting and ensure the object adheres to the given template structure.

                3. **Generate a cumulative project explanation**:
                   - After processing all project files, generate a final **comprehensive project summary** that outlines:
                     - The entire architecture.
                     - Key functionalities of each component.

                     - How the components collaborate to achieve the overall project goals.
                   - Highlight key decisions or patterns used in the project (e.g., microservices, MVC, RESTful APIs, event-driven architecture).
                   - Include any insights regarding scalability, performance, or maintainability.
