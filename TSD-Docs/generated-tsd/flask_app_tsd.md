## Technical Specification Document (TSD)

### 1. **Introduction**
   - **Purpose**: The purpose of this Technical Specification Document (TSD) is to outline the technical requirements, architecture, and implementation details for the Arithmetic Operations API, a simple Flask web application that provides basic arithmetic operations: addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division.
   - **Scope**: This document covers the technical specifications for the Arithmetic Operations API project, including system architecture, component design, data flow, security considerations, deployment, testing strategy, maintenance, and future enhancements.

### 2. **System Overview**
   - **Application Name**: Arithmetic Operations API
   - **Technology Stack**: Python 3.x, Flask
   - **Description**: The Arithmetic Operations API is a RESTful web service that provides endpoints for performing basic arithmetic operations (addition, multiplication, subtraction, division). The API is designed to handle GET requests and return results in JSON format.

### 3. **Architecture Design**
   - **Overview**: The system architecture is based on the Flask web framework, which is lightweight and suitable for building web services. The application is designed to handle HTTP GET requests for various arithmetic operations and return the results in JSON format.
   - **Components**:
     - **Flask Application**: The core component that handles routing and request processing.
       - **Responsibility**: Manage HTTP requests, route them to appropriate functions, and return responses.
       - **Interactions**: Interacts with client applications making HTTP GET requests.

### 4. **Component Design**
   - **Flask Application**:
     - **Routes/Endpoints**:
       - **`/sum`**:
         - **Method**: GET
         - **Description**: Computes the sum of two numbers.
         - **Parameters**:
           - `a`: The first number (float).
           - `b`: The second number (float).
         - **Response**:
           - Success: `{"result": <value>}`
           - Error: `{"error": "<error_message>"}`
       - **`/multiply`**:
         - **Method**: GET
         - **Description**: Computes the product of two numbers.
         - **Parameters**:
           - `a`: The first number (float).
           - `b`: The second number (float).
         - **Response**:
           - Success: `{"result": <value>}`
           - Error: `{"error": "<error_message>"}`
       - **`/subtract`**:
         - **Method**: GET
         - **Description**: Computes the difference between two numbers.
         - **Parameters**:
           - `a`: The first number (float).
           - `b`: The second number (float).
         - **Response**:
           - Success: `{"result": <value>}`
           - Error: `{"error": "<error_message>"}`
       - **`/divide`**:
         - **Method**: GET
         - **Description**: Computes the quotient of two numbers. Handles division by zero error.
         - **Parameters**:
           - `a`: The first number (float).
           - `b`: The second number (float).
         - **Response**:
           - Success: `{"result": <value>}`
           - Error: `{"error": "Division by zero is not allowed."}`, 400

### 5. **Data Flow**
   - **Request Handling**:
     1. Client sends a GET request to one of the endpoints with query parameters `a` and `b`.
     2. Flask routes the request to the appropriate function based on the endpoint.
     3. The function performs the arithmetic operation and returns the result in JSON format.
   - **Error Handling**:
     - Division by zero is managed by returning a 400 status code with an error message.

### 6. **Security Considerations**
   - **Input Validation**: Ensure that input values are properly validated to avoid invalid operations.
   - **Error Handling**: Proper error messages are returned for invalid operations like division by zero.
   - **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement logging to monitor the application and troubleshoot issues. Ensure logs are stored securely and monitored for any anomalies.

### 7. **Deployment Considerations**
   - **Environment**: The application should be run in a Python environment where Flask is installed.
   - **Deployment Strategy**: The application can be deployed using WSGI servers like Gunicorn or directly in a cloud service. Ensure the deployment environment is configured to handle HTTP requests and route them to the Flask application.
   - **Scaling**: The application can be scaled by running multiple instances behind a load balancer. This will distribute the incoming requests across multiple instances and improve performance.

### 8. **Testing Strategy**
   - **Unit Testing**: Test each arithmetic function with different sets of input values to ensure correctness. Use a testing framework like pytest to automate the tests.
   - **Integration Testing**: Test the full API to ensure that all endpoints respond correctly and handle errors gracefully. Use tools like Postman or pytest-flask for integration testing.
   - **End-to-End Testing**: Perform end-to-end testing to ensure that the entire system works as expected from the client request to the server response. This can be automated using tools like Selenium.

### 9. **Maintenance and Future Enhancements**
   - **Maintenance Plan**: Regularly update the application dependencies and address any security vulnerabilities. Monitor the application logs and performance metrics to identify and resolve issues promptly.
   - **Future Enhancements**: Consider adding more complex operations or enhancing the API with additional features like support for different number formats, user authentication, and more detailed error messages.
