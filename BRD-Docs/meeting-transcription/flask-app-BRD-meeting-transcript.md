**Client (Jane Doe):**  
Good morning, John. Thanks for taking the time to discuss the new project we need to work on. We are looking to develop a simple web application that performs basic arithmetic operations.

**Vendor (John Smith):**  
Good morning, Jane. I’m glad to be here. We can certainly help with that. Could you please walk me through the specific requirements?

**Client (Jane Doe):**  
Sure. We need a web-based application that can handle four basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The users should be able to input two numbers, and the application should return the result of the selected operation.

**Vendor (John Smith):**  
That sounds straightforward. Will this application need to handle any edge cases or specific conditions, like division by zero?

**Client (Jane Doe):**  
Yes, it should. If a user tries to divide by zero, the application should return an error message instead of attempting to perform the division.

**Vendor (John Smith):**  
Got it. So, for the division operation, if the denominator is zero, the application will return an error message, something like "Division by zero is not allowed." Does that sound acceptable?

**Client (Jane Doe):**  
Exactly. That would be perfect. Also, we want the application to have a simple, clean interface, with no complex design elements. Just a form where users can enter the numbers and select the operation.

**Vendor (John Smith):**  
Understood. Are there any specific technologies or frameworks you'd prefer us to use for this project?

**Client (Jane Doe):**  
We’d like it to be developed using Python with Flask, as we have some internal resources familiar with Flask for any future maintenance. We also want the application to be accessible via a REST API, so it can be easily integrated with other systems down the line.

**Vendor (John Smith):**  
Flask is a great choice. We’ll build out the endpoints for each of the operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Each operation will have its own dedicated endpoint that will take in two parameters via query strings and return the result in JSON format.

**Client (Jane Doe):**  
That sounds good. What about the deployment? Will you assist us with that as well?

**Vendor (John Smith):**  
Yes, we can guide your team through deploying the application. We typically recommend running Flask apps on a WSGI server like Gunicorn for production, and we can containerize the application using Docker if you plan to deploy it in a cloud environment.

**Client (Jane Doe):**  
We’re considering deploying it on Azure. Can you provide support for that?

**Vendor (John Smith):**  
Absolutely. We can help you set up the necessary resources on Azure and configure everything to ensure a smooth deployment.

**Client (Jane Doe):**  
Perfect. I think that covers the major points. Could you send us a project proposal with a timeline and cost estimate by the end of this week?

**Vendor (John Smith):**  
Of course, I’ll draft a proposal outlining the scope, deliverables, timeline, and costs. You should have it in your inbox by Friday.

**Client (Jane Doe):**  
Thank you, John. Looking forward to working together on this project.

**Vendor (John Smith):**  
Likewise, Jane. Thanks for your time today.
