## Solution Design Document (SDD)

### 1. **Introduction**
   - **Purpose**: This document describes the design of a simple Flask web application that provides basic arithmetic operations: addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division.
   - **Scope**: The application will serve as a RESTful API with endpoints for performing arithmetic operations.

### 2. **System Overview**
   - **Application Name**: Arithmetic Operations API
   - **Technology Stack**: Python 3.x, Flask

### 3. **Architecture Design**
   - **Overview**: The application is built using Flask, a lightweight web framework in Python. It will be deployed as a web service and respond to HTTP GET requests for arithmetic operations.

### 4. **Components**
   - **Flask Application**: The core component that handles routing and request processing.
     - **Routes**:
       - `/sum` - Computes the sum of two numbers.
       - `/multiply` - Computes the product of two numbers.
       - `/subtract` - Computes the difference between two numbers.
       - `/divide` - Computes the quotient of two numbers. Handles division by zero error.
     - **Request Parameters**: 
       - `a` - The first number (float).
       - `b` - The second number (float).
     - **Response Format**:
       - **Success**: `{"result": <value>}`
       - **Error**: `{"error": "<error_message>"}`

### 5. **Data Flow**
   - **Request Handling**:
     1. Client sends a GET request to one of the endpoints with query parameters `a` and `b`.
     2. Flask routes the request to the appropriate function based on the endpoint.
     3. The function performs the arithmetic operation and returns the result in JSON format.
   - **Error Handling**:
     - Division by zero is managed by returning a 400 status code with an error message.

### 6. **Security Considerations**
   - **Input Validation**: Ensure that input values are properly validated to avoid invalid operations.
   - **Error Handling**: Proper error messages are returned for invalid operations like division by zero.

### 7. **Deployment Considerations**
   - **Environment**: The application should be run in a Python environment where Flask is installed.
   - **Deployment**: Can be deployed using WSGI servers like Gunicorn or directly in a cloud service.

### 8. **Testing Strategy**
   - **Unit Testing**: Test each arithmetic function with different sets of input values to ensure correctness.
   - **Integration Testing**: Test the full API to ensure that all endpoints respond correctly and handle errors gracefully.

### 9. **Maintenance and Future Enhancements**
   - **Logging**: Add logging to monitor the application and troubleshoot issues.
   - **Extensibility**: Consider adding more complex operations or enhancing the API with additional features.
